BBQ at Milne Dam Conservation Park, Markham</h4>
<div>
        <p>Despite the potential thunderstorms and heavy rain falls on Sunday, over 30 members, students from University of Toronto (CESA) and McMaster University (MCES), guests, and friends gathered at Milne Dam Conservation Park. PEO Regional Councillor, Thomas Chong, P.Eng., also came to meet with our members and students. We enjoyed a mild and beautiful afternoon with ball games, Frisbee, water spray, cycling, and, of course, some tasty and brownish BBQ chicken wings, steaks, pork chops, veggies, and more. However, we did get wet at the end. Thanks all again for coming to the BBQ event.</p>

Career Experience Sharing Talk in Ontario</h4>
<div>
        <p>On 27th September, 2008, the HKIE Canadian Chapter was delighted to have Ir Loong CHU and Ir Brian LEE to share their successful career experience with our members and student members.</p>

<p>Our first speaker Ir Loong CHU was visiting his family in Toronto at the time of the talk. Loong mentioned to our members one of his favorite animals "Hippo", that reminded him of looking forward and being positive. During the talk Loong emphasized that both effective communication and the ability to see a big picture will help our engineers stand out from the crowd. Loong used an example. If one holds a lantern higher while walking on a dark road, one will be able to see opportunities and threats farther ahead on the road and so better prepare for the next move. Nowadays, engineering are so diversified. Engineers will not only focus on engineering subjects but also prepare to learn continuously on other subjects such as finance and corporate management.</p>

<p>Our second speaker Ir Brian LEE complimented Ir CHU's insights. Brain stressed that engineers usually focus on engineering calculations and design work and seldom spend enough time to learn to communicate and make presentations effectively. Brian also explained to our members various engineer's tasks and duties at the city government and generously shared his top 10 tips for becoming a successful and responsible engineer. These tips help guide engineers to adapt to the dynamic team work environment, become a positive player, and learn to provide values to employer through active participation. At the end of the talk Bran shared his personal career portfolio template with young members and students, so they can prepare their own stories for perspective employer.</p>

<p>The talk was well received by over 30 members.</p>

The HKIE Presidential Visit in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada</h4>
<div>
        <p>This article was seen on HKIE journal HK engineer August 2008 issue.
On 13th June, 2008, the members in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada were honoured to be visited by the President of the HKIE, Ir Dr LO Wai Kwok and the Vice President, Ir Dr Andrew K C CHAN. A reception was held in a hotel where Ir Lo and Ir Chan were greeted by Ir Kam Ho, Chair of the Canadian Chapter and other members in the Toronto area. Ir Wilma Leung, Vice Chair of the Canadian Chapter also flew over from Vancouver.</p>

<p> Ir Lo gave an overview of his work during his term of office as president and how the HKIE is promoting innovation and sustainability in the engineering profession. He also mentioned the importance of nurturing the next generation of engineers and the establishment of new student chapters. Ir Chan gave a presentation on the current engineering profession in Hong Kong. One of his slides showed how the Hong Kong engineering expertise has not only benefited society locally but exported to many other countries globally. We are indeed proud to know that members of the HKIE have contributed to some of the outstanding buildings and engineering masterpieces overseas.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the reception was the presentation of a letter of appointment to Mr. Chris Wong who became the first Chair of the Canadian Chapter Student Section after it was established earlier in March. Mr. Wong has just completed three years of his 4-year Chemical Engineering degree course at McMaster University. </p>

<p>The members in Canada would like to take this opportunity to thank Ir Lo and Ir Chan for visiting Canada and giving the members an update of the Institution and the engineering profession in HK.</p>

<p>Brian LEE</p>
