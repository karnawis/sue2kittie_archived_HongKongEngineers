        <h4 class="btn"> In late 2011, the HKIE appointed me as the 3rd Chairman of the HKIE Canadian Chapter to replace Ir HO Shu Kam who was the Chairman since 2001.</h4>
        <div>
            <p>In the 1980s and 1990s, a number of HKIE members came in Canada.  These members settled in various provinces and territories in Canada.  They have been networking under the coordination of a Corresponding Member in Canada.  In 1999, Ir CHU Chun Loong was tasked by the HKIE to set up the Canadian Chapter, and he became the first Chairman of the Chapter. </p>
            <p> The original purpose of the Chapter was to connect HKIE members who had emigrated to Canada.  Over the years, we have expanded our role and activities.  One of the highlights was the establishment of the first Student Chapter of the HKIE, (even before student chapters were established in post-secondary education institutions in Hong Kong). </p>
            <p> We have seen an increased in Canadian university engineering students who came from Hong Kong or who are interested in working in Hong Kong.  The Chapter reached out to them because we also see the importance of professional mobility in the future.  Looking forward, the Chapter will continue to provide a forum for the HKIE members to network and to exchange professional experience, but it will also play an important role as the bridge between Canada and Hong Kong.</p>
            <p>On behalf of the other members of Chapter Executive Members; Ir HO Shu Kam (Immediate Past President), Ir POON Kay Man (Hon. Secretary), Peter KWOK (Hon. Secretary), and Canadian Student Chapter Chairman Mr. Quincy Lam, I hope your association with the Canadian Chapter to be beneficial and fun.  We look for your supports and suggestions in fulfilling the purpose of the Chapter.

<div>
    <p>Dear members,</p>
    <p>The HKIE Forum on Hong Kong's Climate Change Strategy and Action Agenda </p>
    <p>The Government launched in September a three-month public consultation on Hong Kong's Climate Change Strategy and Action Agenda. The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) commissioned a consultancy study in 2008 to review and update the local inventories of GHG emissions and removals; assess the impacts of climate change in Hong Kong; and recommend long-term strategies and measures to reduce GHG emissions as well as to adapt to the effects of climate change. The consultation paper now presents proposals on the strategy and action agenda drawn up from the consultancy study. Details of the consultation could be viewed at the EPD website at 
                    <a href="http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/climate_change/consult.html">http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/climate_change/consult.html</a></p>.
                    
    <p>With an aim to provide a platform for members to exchange observations and deliberations on the strategies and measures suggested in the consultation paper, a forum on the captioned title, to be chaired by our Vice President Ir CHOY Kin Kuen, will be held on <strong>Monday, 15 November 2010 at 6:15pm at the HKIE Headquarters</strong>. We are delighted to have invited Miss Vivian LAU, Deputy Secretary for the Environment, to give a briefing at the Forum.</p>
    
    <p>For registration, please complete and return the attached <a href="http://www.hkie.org.hk/docs/newsletter/20101025/replyslip.doc">Reply Slip</a> to Miss Ivy TONG via email at <a href="mailto:ivy.tong@hkie.org.hk">ivy.tong@hkie.org.hk</a> or by fax at 2881 0259 on or before Thursday, 11 November 2010</p>.

    <p>Dear All,</p>
    <p>I trust you had a wonderful mother's day weekend.</p>
    <p>If you are a current member of your updated alumni association, you got this news; but just in case, the badminton team of HKU, Poly U Alumni Associations... will engage in friendly competition with those from other Hong Kong universities in the gymnasium of Angus Glen CC (3990 Major Mackenzie Drive East, Markham, ON, L6C 1P8) on Sunday, May 16, 2010 at 3 pm. </p>
    <p>The admission is free, so come in to cheer for your alumni team........once upon a time, you studied in the same campus with them. The <a target="_blank" href="pics/Badminton%20Match%20Table.jpg">match table</a> is attached. The names will remain confidential until then. However, you'll see some familiar faces, guaranteed.</p>
    <p>Regards,</p>
